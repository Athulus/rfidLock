Hello {{$member->name}},\r\n\r\n

Your membership dues for this month were not able to be processed.\r\n\r\n

I can attempt to process the payment again, or we could update the  billing information to ensure that it is accurate.  If you could drop  by during open house on Thursday, or during Saturday hackathon, I'll  be around and we can update the billing information.\r\n\r\n

If you can't make  it out during either of those times, I'd be glad to arrange a time to  meet you at the space, or we could take care of it over the phone.   You can reach me at 804-873-3401, or I can call you if you provide a time and phone number.\r\n\r\n

Weâ€™re also just starting to incorporate Paypal payments if you would prefer to update online.  You can visit the Membership page at http://www.hackrva.org/blog/membership/ and use the Join Now buttons at the bottom of the page to move your payments from Quickbooks to Paypal.\r\n\r\n

Thanks, \r\n
